# In order to just compile a script, use :

go build main.go

# This will generate the executable with name "main", which can be directly run.
# The location would be the same `pwd` :

[nabodip@GyanHouse codes]$ pwd
/home/nabodip/student/golang/codes

[nabodip@GyanHouse codes]$ ls -lrth
total 860K
-rw-rw-r--. 1 nabodip nabodip   75 Apr 28 05:22 main.go
-rwxrwxr-x. 1 nabodip nabodip 853K Apr 28 05:51 main


# hence "go build" would be beneficial for deploying code, when you can move the exe binary to some other location.
